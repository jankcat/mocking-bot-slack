  <h2>
    Conditionals
  </h2>
  <p>
    • The message must be a user text message, not a bot message, image, URL, or server message.<br/>
    • The message must be less than a day old.<br/>
    • Only the first :mocking: will be reacted to.<br/>
    • The message must be at least 4 characters long.<br/>
    • You can probably find ways around these 'rules', but I don't care.
